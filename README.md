# remarkable-mcp-redux

An MCP server that gives Claude direct access to your reMarkable tablet's notebooks. Search documents, render handwritten pages to PDF, and let Claude transcribe your handwriting or convert hand-drawn diagrams into editable formats — all from your local machine, no API keys required.

## What it offers

`remarkable-mcp-redux` is an independently maintained MCP server organised as a proper Python package (`remarkable_mcp_redux`). It provides:

- **Pydantic schema validation** at the cache boundary — `.metadata` and `.content` JSON is parsed and validated into typed models, with ISO-8601 timestamp normalisation and discriminated unions for document vs. folder types.
- **Enriched document metadata** — responses include `file_type`, `document_title`, `authors`, `tags`, `annotated`, `original_page_count`, and `size_in_bytes` sourced from `.content`.
- **Folder listing** — `remarkable_list_folders` exposes `CollectionType` records; `remarkable_list_documents` now correctly excludes them.
- **Filtering** — `remarkable_list_documents` accepts `file_type` and `tag` query parameters.
- **Robust render error handling** — non-zero `rmc` exit codes surface as per-page failures in the response rather than being swallowed.
- **Opt-in write-back tools** — eight write tools covering rename, move, pin, restore, create-folder, rename-folder, move-folder, and bulk backup cleanup. All are guarded behind `REMARKABLE_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` and ship with `dry_run`, atomic writes, automatic sync-flag stamping, and per-document timestamped backups.
- **Sync-aware writes** — every write sets `metadatamodified=True` and `modified=True` so the reMarkable desktop sync engine recognises local edits; folder operations enforce cycle-safety via a parent-chain check, and trashed records are refused with explicit errors.
- **Auto-pruned backups** — each document's `.metadata.bak.*` chain is bounded after every write (default keep last 5, configurable via `REMARKABLE_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT`); a bulk `remarkable_cleanup_metadata_backups` tool also offers age- and document-scoped sweeps.
- **Expanded test suite** — 130+ tests across unit, integration, and e2e layers using entirely synthetic fixtures.

## How it works

The reMarkable desktop app keeps a local copy of your tablet's notebooks and
documents on your Mac. This MCP server reads (and optionally edits) that local
copy, then exposes it to Claude as a small set of tools.

```

The dotted edge marks the opt-in write path; everything else is read-only by
default. **No API keys. No cloud access. Everything runs locally.** The
desktop app handles syncing; this server just reads (and, opt-in, edits) the
files it produces.

### The cache mental model

The desktop cache is **not** a tree of folders on disk. It is a flat directory
of records, each addressed by a UUID. Every document or folder you have
materialises as a fixed family of siblings (and a few child directories) keyed
by the same `<id>`:

```
<cache_root>/
├── <id>.metadata          # JSON: visibleName, parent, type, sync flags, lastModified, ...
├── <id>.content           # JSON: fileType, page index, tags, embedded title, ...
├── <id>.local             # JSON: per-device-only state (sync flags, etc.)
├── <id>.pagedata          # text: per-page template names (one line per page)
├── <id>.pdf               # source PDF                       [fileType=pdf]
├── <id>.epub              # source EPUB                      [fileType=epub]
├── <id>.epubindex         # binary EPUB pagination index     [fileType=epub]
├── <id>.docx              # source DOCX                      [rare]
├── <id>.md                # source markdown                  [rare]
├── <id>/                  # per-page handwritten artifacts (annotated pages only)
│   ├── <page_uuid>.rm                # vector strokes (v6 binary; v5 on legacy docs)
│   └── <page_uuid>-metadata.json     # per-page metadata
├── <id>.thumbnails/       # cached page thumbnails           (PNG per page_uuid)
├── <id>.highlights/       # selection highlights on PDF/EPUB (JSON per page_uuid)
└── <id>.textconversion/   # handwriting OCR results          (JSON per page_uuid)
```

**Always present (one per record):**

- **`<id>.metadata`** — the small JSON record that names and locates a
  document or folder in the user's library. Carries `visibleName`, `parent`
  (UUID of the containing folder, `""` for the root, or `"trash"`), `type`
  (`"DocumentType"` or `"CollectionType"`), `lastModified` (Unix-epoch
  milliseconds as a decimal string), `pinned`, `deleted`, and the sync
  bookkeeping flags (`metadatamodified`, `modified`, `synced`, `version`).
  Documents additionally carry `createdTime`, `lastOpened`, `lastOpenedPage`,
  `new`, and `source`.
- **`<id>.content`** — the JSON record that describes the document's content
  shape. Carries `fileType` (`"pdf"`, `"epub"`, `"notebook"`, or `""`), the
  page index in either v1 form (`pages`: a flat list of UUIDs) or v2 form
  (`cPages.pages[].id`), `pageCount`, `originalPageCount`, user-applied
  `tags` (and per-page `pageTags`), embedded `documentMetadata` (PDF/EPUB
  title and authors), `extraMetadata` (presence of which signals "this
  notebook has annotations"), `sizeInBytes`, and the per-document
  `formatVersion`.
- **`<id>.local`** — JSON of per-device-only state that should not roam to
  the cloud (local sync flags, edit-in-progress markers, etc.). Not
  consulted by this server.
- **`<id>.pagedata`** — plaintext, one template name per line in page-index
  order (e.g. `Blank`, `Lined`, `Blank`, …). Tells the device which
  background template is selected for each page of a notebook.

**Source asset (presence depends on `fileType`):**

- **`<id>.pdf`** — the original PDF the user imported (`fileType: "pdf"`),
  stored verbatim. This server uses it as the rendering substrate when a
  page has no `.rm` annotations (the `pdf_passthrough` source); a future
  follow-up will use it as the base layer when compositing strokes onto an
  annotated PDF.
- **`<id>.epub`** — the original EPUB the user imported
  (`fileType: "epub"`), stored verbatim.
- **`<id>.epubindex`** — a binary index reMarkable derives from the EPUB to
  drive its dynamic pagination and reflow. Lives next to the `.epub` and is
  regenerated on demand by the device.
- **`<id>.docx`** — original DOCX, when an imported document was a Word
  file. Rare in practice; reMarkable converts most DOCX uploads to other
  formats on import.
- **`<id>.md`** — source markdown for documents that originated as plain
  text. Rare.

**Per-page artifacts (one entry per `page_uuid`):**

- **`<id>/`** — the only `<id>...` directory whose contents this server
  reads. Holds up to two files per *annotated* page:
  - **`<page_uuid>.rm`** — the page's vector strokes in reMarkable's binary
    "lines" format. `version=6` on current firmware; `version=5` on legacy
    documents (currently surfaced by the renderer as the structured failure
    code `v5_unsupported`). Pages with no annotations have no `.rm` file at
    all.
  - **`<page_uuid>-metadata.json`** — small JSON with per-page bookkeeping
    (layer names and visibility, transform, etc.) used by the device's page
    editor.
- **`<id>.thumbnails/`** — PNG thumbnails generated by the desktop app, one
  per `<page_uuid>`. Used in the library/grid view; not authoritative
  renders, just a low-resolution cache.
- **`<id>.highlights/`** — JSON per `<page_uuid>` describing text/region
  selections on PDFs and EPUBs (highlight color, anchor offsets, captured
  text). Independent of `.rm` strokes.
- **`<id>.textconversion/`** — JSON per `<page_uuid>` containing the
  handwriting OCR result (recognised text, per-line/per-stroke spans).
  Populated only after the user runs "Convert to Text" on the device.

Folders are records too. A folder is a `.metadata` file with
`type: "CollectionType"`, and "X is inside folder Y" is expressed by X's
`parent` field pointing at Y's id. The empty string `""` means the root;
`"trash"` is a sentinel for the trash bin.

This server only reads the four files it needs to render and reason about
documents — `<id>.metadata`, `<id>.content`, `<id>.pdf`, and
`<id>/<page_uuid>.rm`. Everything else is reMarkable's private state.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph cache [Flat cache directory]
        DocX["Document X (DocumentType)"]
        FolderB["Folder B (CollectionType)"]
        FolderA["Folder A (CollectionType)"]
        DocY["Document Y (DocumentType)"]
    end
    Root["Root sentinel (parent = empty string)"]

    DocX -->|"parent"| FolderB
    FolderB -->|"parent"| FolderA
    FolderA -->|"parent"| Root
    DocY -->|"parent"| Root
```

Every record on disk is a peer in the cache directory. Hierarchy lives only
in the `parent` arrows above, not in the filesystem layout.

### Why "move" only writes metadata

Because containment lives in metadata, moving a document or folder does **not**
relocate any files on disk. `remarkable_move_document` and
`remarkable_move_folder` rewrite the target's `<id>.metadata` with a new
`parent` value and re-stamp `lastModified`, `metadatamodified=true`, and
`modified=true` so the desktop sync engine notices the local edit on its next
pass. The source PDF, notebook pages, and any other blobs stay exactly where
they were. Renames and pins follow the same pattern — a single field changes
in the same `.metadata` JSON, written atomically with a timestamped backup.

This is the same pattern most sync-friendly apps (Drive, Dropbox, photo
libraries, note apps) use: stable record ids, with hierarchy expressed as
relationships rather than filesystem paths. It keeps moves cheap, sync deltas
small, and avoids the path/encoding/duplicate-name problems that filesystem
hierarchies bring.

### Source cache vs. rendered output

There are two distinct piles of files to keep separate:

- **The reMarkable cache**
  (`~/Library/Containers/com.remarkable.desktop/.../desktop`). Owned by the
  desktop app. Read by every tool. Mutated only by the opt-in write tools, and
  only via atomic `.metadata` writes with timestamped backups.
- **Render output** (`/tmp/remarkable-renders/` by default). Owned by this
  server. `remarkable_render_pages` and `remarkable_render_document` write
  `<doc_id>.pdf` here for Claude to read; `remarkable_cleanup_renders` clears
  it. Nothing here is synced anywhere — it's a scratch directory. The
  location is overridable via the `REMARKABLE_RENDER_DIR` environment
  variable; pointing it at a folder your MCP client already has filesystem
  access to (Claude Cowork project subdirectory, Cursor workspace, Desktop
  Commander root, …) lets the model read the merged PDFs directly with its
  native file tools instead of going through the MCP image transport. See
  [Render directory and the Claude Cowork workflow](#render-directory-and-the-claude-cowork-workflow)
  below.

Move, rename, and pin operations only touch the cache; they never update or
relocate anything in the render directory.

## Prerequisites

- **reMarkable desktop app** — installed and synced ([download](https://remarkable.com/desktop))
- **macOS** — the server reads from the standard macOS cache path (Linux support is possible but untested)
- **Python 3.13+**
- **uv** — Python package manager ([install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- **cairo** — system graphics library for SVG→PDF rendering:
  ```bash
  brew install cairo
  ```

## Installation

```bash
uv python install 3.13
git clone https://github.com/Black-Milk/remarkable-mcp-redux.git
cd remarkable-mcp-redux
uv sync
```

## MCP Registration

Add the server to your Claude Code MCP configuration. See `mcp.example.json` for the full template, or add this to your `.mcp.json`:

If you have [`just`](https://just.systems/) installed, generate a config entry
with your local checkout path already filled in:

```bash
just mcp-config
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/bin/bash",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "cd '/path/to/remarkable-mcp-redux' && exec uv run remarkable-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/remarkable-mcp-redux` with the actual path to your cloned repo.

`uv run remarkable-mcp` invokes the `remarkable-mcp` script entry point declared in
`pyproject.toml`. The server sets `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib` automatically
at startup (via `config.ensure_cairo_library_path()`), so no manual export is needed.

## Tools

### Read-only tools (always registered)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remarkable_check_status` | Diagnostics — cache exists? rmc available? cairo available? |
| `remarkable_list_documents` | List documents (folders excluded) with optional `search`, `file_type`, and `tag` filters |
| `remarkable_list_folders` | List folder records (`CollectionType`) with their parent ids |
| `remarkable_get_document_info` | Detailed metadata for a document (rejects folders) |
| `remarkable_render_pages` | Render selected pages to a single PDF; mixes `rm_v6` strokes and `pdf_passthrough` pages, surfaces structured failure codes (`v5_unsupported`, `no_source`, …) |
| `remarkable_render_document` | Render all pages of a document to PDF |
| `remarkable_cleanup_renders` | Remove temporary rendered PDFs |

Document responses are enriched from `.content` with `file_type`, `document_title`,
`authors`, `tags`, `annotated`, `original_page_count`, and `size_in_bytes`. Timestamps
(`last_modified`) are normalized to ISO-8601.

### Write-back tools (opt-in)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remarkable_rename_document` | Update a document's `visibleName` |
| `remarkable_rename_folder` | Update a folder's `visibleName` (sibling-uniqueness enforced) |
| `remarkable_move_document` | Move a document to a different folder (or root) |
| `remarkable_move_folder` | Move a folder to a different parent; response includes `descendants_affected` |
| `remarkable_create_folder` | Create a new folder under any existing folder (or root); two-file atomic write |
| `remarkable_pin_document` | Set or clear a document's `pinned` flag |
| `remarkable_restore_metadata` | Restore a record's `.metadata` from its most recent timestamped backup (undo) |
| `remarkable_cleanup_metadata_backups` | Bulk-delete `.metadata.bak.*` files by age or document id |

These tools mutate the local cache and are **disabled by default**. Enable them by
setting `REMARKABLE_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` in the server's environment.

Safety guarantees:

- Every tool accepts `dry_run=true` to preview without writing.
- Every successful write sets `metadatamodified=True` and `modified=True` on the
  affected `.metadata` so the reMarkable sync engine recognises the edit.
- Every successful write creates a timestamped `<doc_id>.metadata.bak.<UTC>`
  backup before mutation. Use `remarkable_restore_metadata` as the undo lever -
  it creates a pre-restore backup of the live state first, so the restore itself
  is reversible.
- Per-document backup chains are auto-pruned after every write to keep the most
  recent N (default 5; override with `REMARKABLE_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT`).
  `remarkable_cleanup_metadata_backups` covers ad-hoc cleanup across the cache.
- Writes go through a same-directory temp file plus `os.replace`, so a crash
  mid-write cannot leave the cache in a half-written state. Folder creation
  uses a two-file atomic write (`.content` then `.metadata`) and rolls back the
  `.content` if the `.metadata` write fails.
- Targets are validated: rename refuses empty names and trashed records; move
  requires `""` (root) or an existing `CollectionType` folder id, refuses the
  `"trash"` sentinel, refuses moves into the source's own subtree, and (for
  folder moves) reports the descendant count up front.
- **Pause reMarkable desktop sync** before invoking write tools to avoid racing
  with the desktop app's own writes; resume after to push the changes back.

### Sync behaviour

The reMarkable desktop app continuously syncs the local cache with the cloud.
A few things to keep in mind when using this server:

- **Read staleness.** A read tool returns whatever was on disk at the moment it
  ran. If sync writes a new revision a millisecond later, your response is one
  revision out of date - reissue the call to refresh.
- **Active-sync race for writes.** The desktop app does not advertise a "sync
  busy" flag this server can poll, so the safest workflow is: pause sync,
  invoke write tools, verify on disk, resume sync. Each write sets
  `metadatamodified=True` and `modified=True` automatically, which is what the
  desktop app uses to flag a record as "changed locally, push on next sync".
- **Undo path.** Every write creates a timestamped backup. `remarkable_restore_metadata`
  rolls a single record back to its previous state. The restore itself creates
  a pre-restore safety backup, so re-restoring re-applies the change you just
  undid - useful for A/B testing renames or moves.
- **Backup retention.** Per-document chains are auto-pruned after every write.
  Default is "keep the last 5"; set `REMARKABLE_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT=N`
  (`0` = "keep none beyond the one made for this write"). Bulk cleanup is
  available via `remarkable_cleanup_metadata_backups` and requires an explicit
  filter (age or doc id) so an empty call cannot accidentally wipe history.

### Page selection

`remarkable_render_pages` supports flexible page selection:

```python
# Last 5 pages of a document
remarkable_render_pages(doc_id="<uuid>", last_n=5)

# First 3 pages
remarkable_render_pages(doc_id="<uuid>", first_n=3)

# Specific pages (0-indexed)
remarkable_render_pages(doc_id="<uuid>", page_indices=[0, 2, 4])

# All pages (no selection args)
remarkable_render_pages(doc_id="<uuid>")
```

Priority: `page_indices` > `last_n` > `first_n` > all pages. An empty
`page_indices=[]` is rejected explicitly.

### Render directory and the Claude Cowork workflow

By default, both render tools write `<doc_id>.pdf` to
`/tmp/remarkable-renders/`. Set `REMARKABLE_RENDER_DIR` to a different
absolute path (with `~` expansion) to redirect that output anywhere on
disk. The directory is created on demand. `remarkable_cleanup_renders`
only removes files matching the renderer's own `<uuid>.pdf` naming
pattern, so anything else you happen to keep in the same folder is
preserved.

The recommended setup for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview/)
is to point the env var at a subdirectory of the project folder Cowork
already mounts into its agent VM, for example
`~/Documents/Claude/Projects/<project-name>/renders`. The model can then
read the merged PDFs directly via Cowork's native file tools — no
inline-image transport needed. This sidesteps a known cross-client MCP
bug ([anthropics/claude-code#31208](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/31208),
[#15412](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/15412),
[modelcontextprotocol#1638](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1638))
where Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cowork, OpenAI Codex, and VS Code all
silently drop `ImageContent` blocks from tool results whenever
`structuredContent` is also present. See
[`docs/ongoing-mcp-bugs.md`](docs/ongoing-mcp-bugs.md) for the full
analysis. The same workflow also works for Cursor agent mode, Desktop
Commander, and any other client that can read host filesystem paths.

Generate a ready-to-paste Claude Desktop config for a Cowork project with:

```bash
just mcp-config-cowork "My Project"
```

This emits an `mcpServers` block with `REMARKABLE_RENDER_DIR` set to
`~/Documents/Claude/Projects/My Project/renders`.

To enable the opt-in write-back tools at the same time (rename, move, pin,
restore, create-folder, …), use the write-tools variant:

```bash
just mcp-config-cowork-write-tools-enabled "My Project"
just mcp-config-cowork-write-tools-enabled "My Project" 10   # custom backup retention
```

This emits the same render-dir env var plus `REMARKABLE_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true`
and, when supplied, `REMARKABLE_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT=<N>`. See
[Write-back tools (opt-in)](#write-back-tools-opt-in) for the safety
guarantees that come with that flag.

## Usage with Claude

Once registered, Claude can access your reMarkable notebooks directly:

> "Transcribe the last 3 pages of my journal"

> "Find my notebook called 'Architecture Notes' and render page 5"

> "What documents do I have on my reMarkable?"

Rendered PDFs default to `/tmp/remarkable-renders/` (override with
`REMARKABLE_RENDER_DIR` — see
[above](#render-directory-and-the-claude-cowork-workflow)) and can be
cleaned up with `remarkable_cleanup_renders`.

## Companion Skills

The `skills/` directory contains Claude Code skill definitions that wrap the MCP tools into complete workflows:

- **`remarkable-transcribe.md`** — Transcribe handwritten notes to clean Markdown
- **`remarkable-diagram.md`** — Convert hand-drawn diagrams to interactive Excalidraw files

To use these, copy the skill files into your `~/.claude/skills/` directory (or symlink them).

## Architecture

The package is organised in three layers — `tools/` registers MCP surfaces,
`facades/` orchestrates per-domain logic, `core/` provides the underlying
mechanisms. Cross-cutting contracts (annotations, response models, exceptions)
sit at the package root so every layer shares the same vocabulary.

### Response & error contract

Every facade method returns a Pydantic model from `responses.py` on success
and raises a typed `RemarkableError` subclass from `exceptions.py` on failure.
Each tool registration declares `output_schema=<Model>.model_json_schema()`,
so MCP clients receive a JSON Schema for every response. The
`@tool_error_boundary` decorator catches facade-raised exceptions at the wire
and serializes them as a `ToolError` envelope (`error: True`, `detail: <msg>`,
`code: <stable-id>`). Response payloads are sparse by default — unset optional
fields are omitted from the wire to keep token usage tight. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the long-form rationale.

### Rendering pipeline

The rendering pipeline dispatches each page on a typed `PageSource`:

- **`rm_v6`** — vector strokes from current-firmware `.rm` files. `rmc`
  parses the `.rm` into SVG, `cairosvg` rasterises SVG to PDF.
- **`pdf_passthrough`** — unannotated PDF page. `pypdf` slices the requested
  page directly out of the cached `<id>.pdf`; `rmc` is not involved.
- **`rm_v5`** — legacy pre-firmware-v3 strokes. The header is detected up
  front and the page surfaces as a structured failure with
  `code: "v5_unsupported"` instead of crashing the request. Restoring v5
  rendering is tracked as an open follow-up.
- **`missing`** — no `.rm` file and no source-PDF page to fall back to.
  Surfaces as `code: "no_source"`.

Successfully rendered pages are merged into one document via `pypdf` and
written to `<render_dir>/<doc_id>.pdf`. The MCP tool result is a
`ToolResult` carrying multiple parts of the render:

- **Structured content** — the `RenderResponse` JSON: `pages_rendered`,
  `pages_failed[]` (each entry stamped with a stable `code` plus a human
  `reason`), `page_indices`, a `sources_used` summary like
  `{"rm_v6": 5, "pdf_passthrough": 12}` when at least one page rendered,
  and `pdf_path` pointing at the merged PDF on the host. `pdf_path` is
  the right hand-off for clients that can read host filesystem paths
  (Cursor agent mode, Desktop Commander).
- **PNG image blocks (default on)** — the merged PDF is rasterised to one
  `ImageContent` block per rendered page (default 150 DPI) and attached
  to the tool result's `content`. This is the path that works in Claude
  Desktop, which silently drops `application/pdf` `EmbeddedResource`
  payloads. The render tools accept `attach_images=False` to skip
  rasterisation, `image_dpi=<int>` to tune sharpness vs. payload size,
  and `max_image_pages=<int>` (default 10) as a hard cap; renders larger
  than the cap return a `TextContent` note pointing at `pdf_path` /
  suggesting a narrower selection instead of attaching the full image
  batch.
- **PDF EmbeddedResource (opt-in)** — pass `attach_pdf_resource=True` to
  also attach the merged PDF as an MCP `EmbeddedResource` (base64
  `BlobResourceContents`, MIME `application/pdf`). Off by default
  because Claude Desktop strips PDF resources; useful for spec-compliant
  clients that consume non-image embedded resources.

Failure-only renders (no pages rendered) skip every artifact and return
only the structured failure metadata.

Claude reads the resulting page images (or the PDF, for clients that
prefer it) and does whatever you need — transcription, diagram
interpretation, summarisation.

## Tests

```bash
# All tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# By category
uv run pytest tests/ -m unit          # unit tests (synthetic cache)
uv run pytest tests/ -m integration   # tool registration and response shapes
uv run pytest tests/ -m e2e           # full stdio transport
```

Tests use synthetic fixtures — no real reMarkable device or cache required.
